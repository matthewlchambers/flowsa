"""
Flow-By-Activity (FBA) datasets are environmental and economic data that are
generally pulled from publicly available data sources and formatted into
standardized tables (defined in
https://github.com/USEPA/flowsa/blob/master/format%20specs/FlowByActivity.md).
These data are generally unchanged from the source data, with the exception
of formatting.

`getFlowByActivity()` has required and optional parameters
    :param datasource: str, the code of the datasource.
    :param year: int, a year, e.g. 2012
    :param flowclass: str, a 'Class' of the flow. Optional. E.g. 'Water'
    :param geographic_level: str, a geographic level of the data.
        Optional. E.g. 'national', 'state', 'county'.
    # :param download_FBA_if_missing: bool, if True will attempt to load from
    #     remote server prior to generating if file not found locally,
    #     optional, default is False
    :return: a pandas DataFrame in FlowByActivity format
